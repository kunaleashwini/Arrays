Coding Questions on Arrays

An arrray is an object with numbered components.
An array type is defined by appending[] to some other type, like this: String[]
Arrays have the same general properties as other objects: they can be passed to and returned from method, and they can be assigned to other array references.
Arrays can be duplicate with the clone() method.
Arrays can be copied with the System.arraycopy() method.
If you pass an array as an object to System.out.println() method, it will print only the name of the array type and its memory address ex. [I@<hashcosw>.
An elements in arrays have to printed individually, ususally with a for loop.
The java.util.Arrays class define several useful staic utility methods, including binarySearch(array, key), and sort() methods.
The sequential search algorithms runs in linear time : 0(n)
Binary Search algorithm run in logarithmic time: 0(log n)
Multidimensional arrays are arrrays of array.
The rows of two-dimensional array can be arrays of different length.
